<!--The <ul> tag is used to create an unordered list in HTML. It groups a collection of items having no numerical order. When changing the order of list items, the meaning does not change. Usually, the items of an unordered list are displayed with a bullet, which can be of different forms such as a circle, a dot, or a square 1. Each element of an unordered list is declared inside the <li> tag -->
